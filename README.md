# sakaki-jplx
Continuation of Gentoo sakaki-tools.
Gentoo sakaki-tools were developed several years ago. Unfortunately, they are not more maintained because nobody is still availble to support, update and maintain them. However, they are still great and work fine on systems created by following the "sakaki handbook".. So, this project attempts to make them still available by updating the ebuild files. The tarballs are still the same.
